Lab Work done in Assembly for class ESE 381: Embedded Microprocessor Systems Design II

A continuation of Embedded Microcontroller Systems Design I. The entire system design cycle, including requirements definition and system specifications, is covered. Topics include real-time requirements, timing, interrupt driven systems, analog data conversion, multi-module and multi-language systems. The interface between high-level language and assembly language is covered. A complete system is designed and prototyped in the laboratory.
